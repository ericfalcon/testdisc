"""Response-quality checks that can actually return a bad verdict.

The metric this replaces was ``82 + variance * 8.5`` clamped to 75-99, which
could only ever report that the person had been consistent. Everything here is
computable from a single respondent's answers, which rules out the classical
sample-based coefficients (Cronbach's alpha needs variance across people, not
across items within one person).
